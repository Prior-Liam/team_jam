-What is this project about?
Since we talked about it in class I'm assuming we have to save the wav files/ binary files to vectors to be able to manipulate them to have an echo or go back to normal. To make them have an echo we can use what Dr. L said in class today. I have a picture of the code he wrote on my phone. To find out how long the vector should be we use logarithms and other math. Then he created a new file and saved the changed audio there. At some point we'll have to compress files? First image with boxes is Model-View-Controller pattern. Don't know what model exactly represents. The view is the UI. Don't know what the processors are?

-Classes vs Structures
Structures: default specifier: public
Classes: Default specifier: private

-Structure Account Code
//Create Account struct
#include <iostream>

struct Account
{
  std::string username;
  std::string email;
  std::string password;
  int creditCardNum;
  
};


//---------------------------------------------------------------

//main.cpp
//Pretend you're coding in the main. Create an instance of Account and set values to all the attributes in Account
int main()
{
  Account acc; //acc = acocunt

  //Already public so we don't need getters or setters.
  std::cin >> acc.username;
  std::cin >> acc.email;
  std::cin >> acc.password;
  std::cin >> acc.creditCardNum;
}

-Wave File Format
http://soundfile.sapp.org/doc/WaveFormat/

-Wave File Structure Code
typedef struct wav_header
{
  char chunkID[4];
  int chunkSize;
  char format[4];

  char subchunk1ID[4];
  int subchunk1Size;
  short audioFormat;
  short numChannels;
  int sampleRate;
  int byteRate;
  short blockAlign;
  short bitsPerSample;

  char subchunk2ID[4];
  int subchunk2Size;
} WAV_HEADER;

typedef and WAV_HEADER allows you to put 
WAV_HEADER w; 
instead of 
struct wav_header w;

binary files look like hexadecimal

-What are binary files?
bytes; usually in unicode and ascii

-How can we read a wav file?
The struct we made gives it a template to read the wav file.

-How do we know if a binary file is a wav file?
If it contains "WAVE".

-Helpful website for fileIO including binary files

-Mini project:
Wav.cpp file from Wav.h struct
Read File

#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include "Wav.h"

void Wav::readFile(const std::string &fileName){
  std::ifstream a_file(fileName, std::ios::binary | std::ios::in);
  if(!a_file.is_open()){
    std::cout << "This file could not be opened." << std::endl;
  }
  else{
    //read wave header
    a_file.read ((char*)&wavHeader, sizeof(wav_header));

    buffer = new unsigned char[wav_header.data_bytes];
    //read sound data
    a_file.read ((char*)buffer, wav_header.data_bytes);
    a_file.close();
  }
}
